            I wanted to learn how Wordpress functioned. 
            I have usually worked on websites that were built from the ground up, so it was interesting to learn how to use a website builder.
            Having less control on the UI aspects was a downside. 
            However, not having to handle deployments and security or payment integration allowed for faster turn around times.
