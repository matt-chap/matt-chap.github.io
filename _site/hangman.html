            First app that I made in <strong>Android Studio</strong>. 
            I wanted to learn the process behind getting an app on the Google Play store. 
            Also, I wanted to learn how to run ads in an application. 
            Using AdMob and the google play store I was able to learn a lot about the development services offered.
            Currently, I am also looking to add logging and crash reports with firebase.
